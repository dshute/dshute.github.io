# Moving to Jekyll

I don't know what it is. I hate Wordpress. I really dislike dealing with the clunky admin user interface and, given that my webhosting is terrible, working with a slow DB on the back end just makes things even worse. 

I shouldn't need to fight with a web UI or access a control panel to post content. It's (mostly) just text. I should be able to do this with a text editor. 

With that in mind, when I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) I nearly tripped over myself in an effort to get it up and migrate all my content over to it.

My blog is a static website. Most of the functionality that WordPress is built for is being wasted by me and largely just leaving open a bunch of very large holes for attackers to walk through. 

Does this mean anything for the blog itself? Not really. Mostly it just removes that possibility of my site serving up malware due to WordPress vulnerabilities.
