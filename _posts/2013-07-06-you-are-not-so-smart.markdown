I recently finished reading David McRaney’s [You Are No So Smart](http://youarenotsosmart.com/the-book/). It’s an entertaining read all about our biases, broken heuristics, and logical fallacies. Basically, all the cognitive shortcuts that bypass our ability to be the rational and logical beings that we, in our deluded default state, consider ourselves to be.

The style is very similar to what McRaney posts on his [website](http://youarenotsosmart.com/). For a sample, I suggest the fairly recent posting on [survivorship bias](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/). If you’ve been exposed to [inattention or change blindness](http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/), and who in software testing hasn’t by now, and found that appealing this expands far beyond those two concepts.
