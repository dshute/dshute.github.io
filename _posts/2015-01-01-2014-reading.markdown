I didn’t read nearly as much as I’d have liked to this year. I’m also not terribly big on reviewing or critiquing books. Given that, I’m just going to plunk down the unfortunately small list of what I’ve gotten through this year. If it’s in this list it means I finished it, and I don’t suffer reading things that don’t interest me, if that’s any help. I’m glad to put down any book that stops interesting me, regardless of the time or money invested.

As I don’t plan to do any real review on books in the future, I suspect this type of thing will move to a permanent link to my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5181223-david-shute?shelf=%23ALL%23) or something similar. Something to be updated without notice.

Not only has my reading dropped off in general, but fiction has almost completely fallen away entirely. I think a lot of this has to do with my obsessive consumption of podcasts. I should really look to remedy this in 2015.
