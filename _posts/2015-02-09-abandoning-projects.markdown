I posted the above tweet back in January for a reason. As I’ve been working through my upcoming audio drama project I’ve been putting a significant amount of time into scripting. The premise, as previously noted, has been episodic, short content. What that has meant is the need to have a collection of short scripts.

- collect ideas
- rough out a story structure
- deliver a script
- repeat ten times over in as many weeks

Narconovelas had been brought to my attention some time in the last year. Here’s a [good introduction](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/06/135148342/narco-novelas-play-out-drama-of-mexican-drug-war) if you’re not familiar. I’d also heard about [Diana, the vigilante hunter of bus drivers](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/03/mexico-killer-vigilante-diana-bus-drivers). While working through some ideas for scripts these two basic ideas came together. Though Diana is real, I was interested in how Mexican folklore or ghost stories might line up in an interesting way with narconovelas to create a unique story.

What happened with the above is I realized that as much as I liked the idea I really didn’t have the background to put it together.  I know very little about narconovelas and even less about Mexican folklore / ghost stories. In general I know very little about Mexican culture as a whole. It’s just not something I’ve had much exposure to.

Given that, what the fuck would I be writing about?

There is no grounding, no foundation to build upon. The whole concept is just a bad idea for me. It would be a slog to work through no matter how much I liked (and still like) the general idea. It became an important point to be able to say this is a bad project (for me) and that it was time to walk away from it (for now) to focus on other projects that would be more beneficial (in this moment).

I may come back to this idea in the future, but today is not that day.
