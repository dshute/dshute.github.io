I wasn't really sure where I was focusing all my time, so I started up a basic spreadsheet and started roughly tracking.

I've since stopped tracking my time as it's told me exactly what I wanted to know. I spend way more time on leisure pursuits than I do on creative work. Once I had proof I started to change it.
