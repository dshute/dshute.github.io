I have two corollaries to this.

- So long as you don't ask me the same question over and over again.

If you keep asking me over and over, barring a learning/memory disorder, I'm going to assume you're not listening or don't care. In either case, why are you wasting my time and yours?

- That you've already tried to find an answer to your question.

If you haven't already gone looking for information you're either asking too broad a question and don't know where to start or you're too lazy to do the work yourself.

There's an obvious exception here. Sometimes, information is easier spread in quick bursts in passing. When this is time or project sensitive information, chances are a question and answer are going to be quicker than performing research.
