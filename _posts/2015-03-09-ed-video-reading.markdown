I don't know that this date has been solidified as of yet, but it looks like the screenwriting competition they held a couple weekends ago will have it's reading night on April 7th at 6:30 PM.

I like my entry ([Thorium Blue]({{site.url}}/writing/Thorium-Blue-David-Shute.pdf)) for something that I threw together in a weekend. Does it have enough to win any prizes? I have no idea.
