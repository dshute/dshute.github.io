I've found myself in this place again. Surrounded by lots of deadlines and not doing much in the way of forward momentum. I've taken to manually migrating my blog from WordPress to Jekyll in place of acutally getting anything done. 

I'm kind of okay with this. 

I'm not really worried about my deadlines.  I know what I have left to work on and I have a good idea of how much effort it's going to take. I'm fairly comfortable in my ability to get these things done, but it certainly says something about my style of work.

I know fully well that if I'd just work on those commitments I'd get them done and then I wouldn't feel like the work I'm doing to migrate my blog is _"the wrong thing"_ as it would be the only thing on my plate.

That's not true.

Over committing feels like it's wired into my brain.
