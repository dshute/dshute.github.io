Nothing like looming deadlines to kick me into high gear. 

After pushing out the instrumental demo I have confirmed that I'll be recording the vocal tracks with the actress this Saturday. It's an interesting problem as I've never done much in the way of making my recording rig mobile. It's not inherently stationary, but I'm constantly adding and removing pieces. Thinking about it in a whole manner, concerned about what I need to take with me, is a new problem.

The recording rig is actually going to be very simple, now that I've taken the time to figure it out. I'll be recording right to my laptop through a Line6 UX2. I'd prefer to use my Focusrite Scarlett, but I need the UX2 regardless to be able to use the PodFarm plugin. The higher quality signal would be nice, but not nice enough to lug around two USB interfaces.

From the UX2 I'll be going out to a Behringer Microamp.  This is a super simple little amp that has four headphone outputs with individual levels. Everything else will be running out to headphones.  The Audio-Technica AT-2035 that I've got will be more than sufficient to get the job done. I've got a great shotgun mic, but I haven't gotten around to picking up a decent condenser mic just yet. 

Ideally I should be able to be in and out in about an hour. Fifteen minutes to set up, around a half hour to record, then backup the session to external hard drive, tear down, and be on my way. 

This somehow feels wildly optimistic...
