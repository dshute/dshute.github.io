Just some stuff that I saw this week worth sharing along.

An episode of The Nod that's worth listening to (along with the rest of the archive): [Sister, Sister](https://www.gimletmedia.com/the-nod/sister-sister#episode-playeR)

A quick software testing blog post from Michael Bolton: [Testing and Management Efficiency](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2018/02/efficiency/)

A browser plugin that finds papers at alternate sources that aren't hidden behind paywalls: [unpaywall](http://unpaywall.org)

A research paper that is well described by its title: [HbA1c, diabetes and cognitive decline: the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-017-4541-7)

And a bunch of free textbooks, if you're into that sort of thing: [Openstax Textbooks](https://openstax.org/)
