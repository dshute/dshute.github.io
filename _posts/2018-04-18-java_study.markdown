I've been working through learning Java lately. It is far from my ideal language to be studying, but there are some solid reasons for doing so. Not the least of which is the creeping necessity to get some mobile automation up and running at work. Although we haven't settled on a framework just yet, it honestly seems like running Appium with Java is the best bet short of going native. As much I'm okay with the idea of going native for Android the thought horrifies me with iOS.

A close second to that is simply the desire to actually be functional in a programming language. While I've got some survival Ruby under my belt and a (very) basic understanding of C#, I'm not really proficient as a programmer. This is partially a lack of depth with any given language and, more importantly, a lack of exposure to churning out algorithms. 

It also puts me on a couple of different possible paths. I've wanted to put together some Android apps for awhile. Java gets me closer to that. I've also wanted to learn C++ for a very long time. Java is a good bridge to take me from Ruby to C++ while also building up a good amount of general programming knowledge to support me (if) when I get to C++. 

Java is also a solid choice just due to the sheer number of quality, free resources. I'm primarily using three main resources.

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

There's currently a 30 Days of Code challenge going on. This has helped to continually expose me to different concepts and keep me coming back every day. When the 30 Days of Code is done there's still a ton of stuff to keep me coming back daily.

[Object-Oriented programming with Java @ MOOC.fi](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/)

A very solid MOOC hosted by the University of Helsinki. It starts from the basics and works up. It's provided as a collection of lessons and applications to complete. The interesting part is that the applications come with unit tests that must be satisfied to gain the marks to move forward in the program.

While working through some of these applications, the unit tests really helped to show places where my logic failed with specific input. It's been very valuable in that respect. It also helps throttle back my impulse to jam through as quick as possible. I can't ignore something "trivial" if it fails the tests.

[Java @ Learn How To Program](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/java)

I've really taken to this one because it's structured around a 4 week bootcamp style program. Not only does it take time to teach appropriate Java skills, it's also big on working with git, producing clean repos by using .gitignore properly, and writing unit tests for your work. It's been a good companion to go along with the Helsinki MOOC.

Overall, I don't know how far I'm going to take Java, but I am pretty awful with programming despite how long I've been flirting with it. As a tester, it's a skills gap. As a person, it's a tool I've underutilized for far too long.
