Working with a Broken Machine is just another (largely unnecessary) personal blog. At a point it was dedicated solely to writing and filmmaking. It then changed to software testing. Eventually it found its way to being another directionless personal blog. I like many things. Very few enough to talk about exclusively.

I am currently in the process of migrating my existing (terrible wordpress) blog to Jekyll. As it is a manual, albeit minor, process, it may take some time.
